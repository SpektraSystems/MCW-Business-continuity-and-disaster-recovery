## Exercise 1: Deploy Azure environments

Duration: 15 minutes (Deployments can take as long as 75 minutes)

In this exercise, you will use Azure ARM templates to deploy the following environments used in this HOL:

- **Azure IaaS:** This environment will consist of two Virtual Networks deployed to your Primary and Secondary site with an AD Domain, IIS Web Servers and Microsoft SQL Servers that you will configure into a SQL Always On Availability Group.

- **On-premises:** This environment will deploy a Hyper-V Host that will host a Linux VM to simulate a web application deployed into on-premises data center on a single VM. Your goal for this environment will be to migrate this application to Azure IaaS with a one-direction failover.

- **Azure PaaS:** This environment will deploy an Azure Web App and Azure SQL Server in both the Primary and Secondary locations.

### Task 1: Deploy Azure IaaS

1. From **LABVM**, open Internet Explorer and connect to the Azure portal at: <https://portal.azure.com>.

2. Select **+Create a resource** and then search for **Template Deployment**.

    ![Template Deployment is typed in the New blade search field.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image27.png "Azure Portal New blade")

3. Select **Template deployment** and then **Create**.

    ![Template deployment is selected in the search results.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image28.png "Resource search results")

4. On the **Custom deployment** blade, select **Build your own template in the editor**.

    ![In the Custom deployment blade, the link to build your own template in the editor is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image29.png "Custom deployment blade")

5. On the **Edit template** blade, select **Load file**.

    ![In the Edit template blade menu, Load file is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image30.png "Edit template blade")

6. From the `C:\HOL\Deployments` directory, locate the **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite.json** file and select **Open**.

7. This will load the template into the Azure portal. Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Save button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image31.png "Save button")

8. On the **Custom deployment** blade, select your **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite** resource group. Notice how the template picked the deployment region based on the location of your **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite** resource group. Make sure this is *your* **Primary** region.

    ![In the Custom deployment blade, fields are populated based on the BCDRIaaSPrimarySite resource group. A call out highlights the Location field that is set to the Primary region value.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image32.png "Custom deployment blade")

9. Next, update the **Domain Controller DNS Name** in the **Settings** area. This will be the DNS name for the Active Directory Domain controller that will be your jump box into the IaaS environment. The name will need to be lowercase and 3-24 characters consisting of letters & numbers and be unique to all of Azure. In the example, the DNS name `bcdrdc8675309` was used.

    ![In the Settings section, the Domain Controller DNS Name field is populated.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image33.png "Settings section")

10. Finally, select **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** and **Pin to dashboard.** Select **Purchase** to start the deployment.

    ![The check boxes for pin to dashboard and I agree to the terms and conditions are checked. The Purchase button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image34.png "Purchase button")

> **Note:** This deployment will take at least 60 minutes, but you can continue to the next task.

### Task 2: Deploy on-premises environment

1. From the **LABVM**, open Internet Explorer and connect to the Azure portal at: <https://portal.azure.com>.

2. Select **+Create a resource** and then search for **Template Deployment**.

    ![In the Azure portal New blade, Template Deployment is in the search field.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image27.png "Azure portal, New blade")

3. Select **Template deployment** and then **Create**.

    ![Template deployment is selected in the search results.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image28.png "Resource search results")

4. On the **Template deployment** blade, select **Build your own template in the editor**.

    ![The Build your own template in the editor link is selected in the Template deployment blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image29.png "Template deployment blade")

5. On the **Edit template** blade, select **Load file**.

    ![In the Edit template blade top menu, Load file is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image30.png "Edit template blade")

6. From the `C:\HOL\Deployments` directory locate the **BCDROnPremPrimarySite.json** file and select **Open**.

7. This will load the template into the Azure portal. Select **Save**.

8. On the **Custom deployment** blade, next to **Resource group** select your **BCDROnPremPrimarySite** resource group. Notice how the template picked the deployment region based on the location of your **BCDROnPremPrimarySite** resource group. Make sure this is *your* **Primary** region.

    ![In the Custom deployment blade, Basics section, fields are set to values based on your primary region.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image35.png "Custom deployment blade, Basics section")

9. Next, update the **Hyper-V Host DNS Name** in the **Settings** area. This will be the DNS name for the Hyper-V Host that you will use for this simulated on-premises environment. The name will need to be lowercase and 3-24 characters consisting of letters & numbers and be unique to all of Azure. In the example, the name `hypervhost8675309` was used.

    ![In the Settings section, the Domain Controller DNS Name field is populated.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image36.png "Settings section")
