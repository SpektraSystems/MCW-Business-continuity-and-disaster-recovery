## Exercise 4: Simulate failovers

Duration: 75 minutes

Now, that your applications have been made ready for high-availability and BCDR you will now simulate their capabilities. First, you will failover the **Azure IaaS environment** from your **Primary** to **Secondary** region. Next, you will migrate the **On-Premises** environment to Azure. The **PaaS** environment will be tested to ensure that failing over the database doesn't cause an outage to the application. Finally, you will failback the Azure IaaS environment from the **Secondary** site to the **Primary** site.

### Task 1: Failover Azure IaaS region to region

![The Azure IaaS region to region failover diagram displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image317.png "Azure IaaS region to region failover diagram")

1. Using the Azure portal, open the **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite** resource group. Locate the Front Door Frontend Host URL and select it to ensure that the application is up and running from the Primary Site. Pin the Front Door to your dashboard for easy access to this URL or make a favorite in your browser.

    ![The Frontend host link is called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image318.png "Frontend host")

2. From the Azure portal, open the **BCDRRSV** Recovery Services Vault located in the **BCDRAzureSiteRecovery** resource group.

6. On the warning about No Test Failover, select **I understand the risk, Skip test failover**.

    ![A warning displays that no test failover has been done in the past 180 days, and recommends that you do one before a failover. At the bottom, the I understand and skip test failover checkbox is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image322.png "Failover warning")

7. Review the Failover direction. Notice that **From** is the **Primary** site, and **To** is the **Secondary** site. Select **OK**.

    ![Call outs in the Failover blade point to the From and To fields.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image323.png "Failover blade")

8. After the Failover is initiated, close the Failover blade and move to **Recovery Plans (Site Recovery)**. Select the **Failover** job to monitor the progress.

    ![Failover is selected in the Site Recover jobs blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image324.png "Site Recover jobs blade")

9. You can monitor the progress of the Failover from this panel.

    > **Note:** Do not make any changes to your VMs in the Azure portal during this process. Allow ASR to take the actions and wait for the failover notification prior to moving on to the next step. You can open another portal view in a new browser tab and review the output of the Azure Automation Jobs, by opening the jobs and selecting Output.
    >
    > ![Output is selected on the Job blade, and information displays in the Output blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image326.png "Job and Output blades")

10. Once the job has finished, it should show as *Successful* for all tasks. This may take more than 15 minutes.

    ![Under Job, the status for the job steps all show as successful.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image327.png "Job status section")

11. Details of the failover Web server VMs are shown. Notice how they are now running on the **BCDRFOVNET** network. This is the failover virtual network running in the **Secondary** Site.

    ![WEBVM1 and its network / subnet and Recovery point information are selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image328.png "Environment Details blade")

19. The Application running on the WEBVM1 and WEBVM2 is now responding from the **Secondary** site. Make sure to select the current Policy Offerings to ensure that there is connectivity to the SQL Always-On group that was also failed over in the background.

    ![The Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image335.png "Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage ")

    ![The Index webpage displays the insurance options.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image336.png "Index webpage")

20. Select **DNS Name URL**. The site loads immediately and is failed over. Web site users will always be using this DNS URL, so there is no change in how they access the site even though it is failed over. There **will** be downtime as the failover happens, but once the site is back online the experience for them will be no different than when it is running in the **Primary** site.

    ![The Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage displays with a call out pointing to the URL in the address bar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image338.png "Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage")

    > **Optional task**: If you wish, you can RDP to **SQLVM3** and open the SQL Management Studio to review the Failed over **BCDRAOG**. You will see that **SQLVM3** which is running the **Secondary** site is now the Primary Replica.

21. Now, that you have successfully failed over you need to prep ASR for the Failback. Move back to the **BCDRSRV** Recovery Service Vault using the Azure portal. Select **Recovery Plans** on the ASR dashboard.

    ![Recovery Plans is highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image339.png "Recovery Plans")

19. Now, that you have successfully failed back you need to prep ASR for the Failover again. Move back to the **BCDRSRV** Recovery Service Vault using the Azure portal. Select Recovery Plans on the ASR dashboard.

    ![A Recovery Plans tile with the number 1 displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image339.png "Recovery Plans tile")

20. The BCDRIaaSPlan will show as **Failover completed**. Select the Plan.

    ![In the BCDRSRV blade a call out points to the failover completed message.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image340.png "BCDRSRV blade")

21. Notice that now 2 VMs are shown in the **Source**.

22. Select **More**, then select **Re-protect**.

    ![In the BCDRSRV blade, the More ellipses is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image342.png "BCDRSRV blade")

23. On the **Re-protect** screen review the configuration and then select **OK**.

24. The portal will submit a deployment. This process will take some time, by first committing the failover and then synchronizing the **WEBVM1** and **WEBVM2** back to the **Primary** Site. Once this process is complete, then you will be able to Fail over again from the **Primary** to **Secondary** site from the perspective of ASR.

25. Next, you need to reset the SQL AOG environment to ensure a proper failover. To do this open Remote Desktop to **BCDRDC1** and then jump to **SQLVM1** using Remote desktop.

26. Once connected to **SQLVM1** open SQL Management Studio and Connect to **SQLVM1**. Expand the **Always On Availability Group**s and then right-click on **BCDRAOG** and then select **Show Dashboard**.

    ![In SQL Management Studio, the right-click menu for BCDRAOG (Primary) displays, and Show Dashboard is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image198.png "SQL Management Studio")

27. Notice that all the Replica partners are now Synchronous Commit with Automatic Failover Mode. You need to manually reset **SQLVM3** to be **Asynchronous** with **Manual Failover**.

    ![The Availability group dashboard displays with SQLVM3 and its properties called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image400.png "Availability group dashboard")

28. Right-click the **BCDRAOG** and select **Properties**.

    ![In Object Explorer, the right-click menu for BCDRAOG displays with Properties selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image401.png "Object Explorer")

29. Change **SQLVM3** to **Asynchronous** and **Manual Failover** and select **OK**.

    ![In the Availability Group Properties window, under Availability Replicas, the SQLVM3 server role is secondary, availability mode is asynchronous commit, and failover mode is manual.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image402.png "Availability Group Properties window")

30. Show the Availability Group Dashboard again. Notice that they change has been made and that the AOG is now reset.

> **Note:** This task could have been done using the Azure Automation script during Failback, but more DBAs would prefer a good, clean failback and then do this manually once they are comfortable with the failback.
