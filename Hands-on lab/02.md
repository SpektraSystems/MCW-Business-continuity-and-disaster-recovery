The Runbook type should default to **PowerShell Workflow**. Notice that the Name can't be changed. This is the name of the Workflow inside of the Runbook script. Select **Create**.

    ![Fields in the Import blade are set to the previously defined settings. A call out points to the read-only Name field.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image65.png "Import blade")

23. Once the Runbook is imported, the PowerShell runbook will load. If you wish, you can review the comments to better understand the runbook. Once completed, select **Publish** to make the code available for use in the portal.

    ![On the top menu of the Edit PowerShell Workflow Runbook blade, Publish is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image68.png "Edit PowerShell Workflow Runbook blade")

24. Select **Yes** to configure that this Runbook will be published.

    ![In the Publish Runbook section, a message asks if you want to proceed, and the Yes button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image62.png "Publish Runbook section")

    ![Screenshot of the successful Published runbook message.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image69.png "Published runbook message")

25. Navigate back to **Runbooks**, and make sure that both Runbooks show as **Published**.

    ![Two runbooks have authoring status as published: ASRSQLFailover, and ASRWEBFailover.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image70.png "Runbooks")

26. From **LABVM**, select **Start** and select **PowerShell ISE** (make sure to right-click and Run as Administrator).

    ![Screenshot of the Windows PowerShell ISE icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image71.png "Windows PowerShell ISE icon")

27. Open the file `C:\HOL\Deployments\ASRRunBookVariable.ps1`. Review the script and enter the automation account name you created earlier. Then select the green play button to execute the script. You will need to authenticate to Azure.

    ![In the Windows PowerShell ISE window, the green play button is selected, and a call out points to the $AutomationAccountName variable definition in the script window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image72.png "Windows PowerShell ISE window")

    > **Note**: If you are using an account that has multiple subscriptions you may need to change the subscription associated with your current Azure session. You can comment out the **Connect-AzAccount** command in the script and complete the login and the use the **Connect-AzAccount** and **Set-AzContext** cmdlets to create the proper context for this HOL. For help, you can review this article: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/manage-subscriptions-azureps?view=azps-2.7.0#change-the-active-subscription>.

28. Once the script has run, you will see the following output from PowerShell ISE. This script created a variable that will be used with the PowerShell Runbook in Azure Automation to help with the Failover and Failback of the Azure IaaS environment.

    ![Screenshot of PowerShell ISE output.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image73.png "PowerShell ISE output")

29. Move back to the Azure portal and locate the **Azure Automation** account. Select the **Variables** link in the **Shared Resources** section.

    ![In the Automation Account blade, Variables is selected from the menu.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image74.png "Automation Account blade")

30. Notice that the variable **BCDRIaaSPlan** has been created. This variable will be used along with ASR to orchestrate part of the failover.

    ![In the Automation Account blade, under Name, a call out highlights the BCDRIaaSPlan variable.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image75.png "Automation Account blade")

> **Note:** When you configure the ASR Recovery Plan for the IaaS deployment you will use the SQL Runbook as a Pre-Failover Action and the Web Runbook as a Post-Failover action. They will run both ways and have been written to take the "Direction", of the failover into account when running.
